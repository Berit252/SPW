  "Understanding is an art and not everyone is an artist.",

  "Everyone has the gift of creativity, but not everyone is an artist.",
  "You can be an “artistic” mother, an “artistic” manager, an “artistic” bus driver, even an “artistic” politician. It doesn’t matter what your means of expression are.",
  "Aesthetic behaviour is no threshold, anyone can carry out their own aesthetic behaviour, aesthetic level has a threshold, so everyone's aesthetic result is different.",
  "The dogma of “everyone is an artist” Of all the dogmatisms that have been imposed to destroy art this is the most pernicious.",
  "“Everyone is an artist” does not mean that everyone “is” an artist, but that everyone could be and “should be” an artist."
